 <h1>Greetings</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my webpage.</p>
     <p>I Hope! You will learn and understand my topic.</p>
  <p><em><strong>I am trying to give information about libraries.</strong></em></p>
     <P>Libraries are important cornerstones of a healthy community.  Libraries give people the opportunity to find jobs, explore medical research, experience new ideas, get lost in wonderful stories, while at the same time providing a sense of place for gathering. Libraraies are lifeline to the world and all the information in it.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          library sample design">
