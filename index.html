     <p>Hope! You will learn and understand my topic.</p>
      <p>I am trying to give information about libraries.</P>
     <P>Libraries are important cornerstones of a healthy community.  Libraries give people the opportunity to find jobs, explore medical research, experience new ideas, get lost in wonderful stories, while at the same time providing a sense of place for gathering. Libraraies are lifeline to the world and all the information in it.</p>
